The CCDH aims to provide relevant standards and tooling for the CRDC community. Below are curated lists of relevant standards and tools for use in data harmonization, aggregation, modeling and other use cases. Please [contact us](centerforcancerdh@gmail.com) or join our [office hours](https://ccdhportaldev.pedscommons.org/support) for any questions related to ontologies, standards or tooling.

## Standards
Ontology/Terminology |	Abbreviation	| Description
-- | -- | --
AJCC staging system	| AJCC | A classification system developed by the American Joint Committee on Cancer for describing the extent of disease progression in cancer patients
Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium	| CDISC	| CDISC develops and advances data standards to transform incompatible formats, inconsistent methodologies, and diverse perspectives into a powerful framework for generating clinical research data that is as accessible as it is illuminating.
Cancer Data Standards Registry and Repository	|CaDSR | The caDSR and its associated applications help the research community manage and use data standards by providing the shared standards in a variety of human and machine readable contexts.
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events | CTCAE	| CTCAE is widely accepted throughout the oncology community as the standard classification and severity grading scale for adverse events in cancer therapy clinical trials and other oncology settings.
Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine | DICOM	| DICOMÂ® is the international standard for medical images and related information. It defines the formats for medical images that can be exchanged with the data and quality necessary for clinical use.
eagle-i Resource Ontology	| ERO | ERO models research resources such instruments. protocols, reagents, animal models and biospecimens. It was developed in the context of the eagle-i project.
Environmental and Exposures Ontology |ECTO |The purpose of ECTO is to create compositional classes that assemble existing OBO ontologies such as ExO, CHEBI and ENVO to make ready-made precomposed classes for use in describing:
Genotype Ontology	| GENO | An integrated ontology for representing the genetic variations described in genotypes, and their causal relationships to phenotype and diseases.
Human Phenotype Ontology | HPO | HPO provides a standardized vocabulary of phenotypic abnormalities encountered in human disease. Each term in the HPO describes a phenotypic abnormality
Image biomarker standardisation initiative | IBSI | IBSI is an independent international collaboration which works towards standardizing the extraction of image biomarkers from acquired imaging for the purpose of high-throughput quantitative image analysis (radiomics). 
International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems	| ICD-9, ICD-10, ICD-11 | A medical classification list by the World Health Organization (WHO) that contains codes for diseases, signs and symptoms, abnormal findings, complaints, social circumstances, and external causes of injury or diseases.
International Classification of Diseases for Oncology |ICD-O | A domain-specific extension of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems for tumor diseases.
Integrated Semantic Framework	| ISF	| The VIVO-ISF ontology provide a set of types (classes) and relationships (properties) to represent researchers and the full context in which they work.
LOINC	| LOINC	| The international standard for identifying health measurements, observations, and documents.
Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities	| MEDDRA	| MedDRA is an international medical terminology with an emphasis on use for data entry, retrieval, analysis, and display.
Mondo Disease Ontology	| Mondo	| Mondo is a disease ontology that represents disease terminology across species. It is a semi-automatically constructed ontology that merges in multiple disease resources to yield a coherent merged ontology.
NCBI Taxonomy	| NCBI Taxon	| The NCBI Taxonomy Database is a curated classification and nomenclature for all of the organisms in the public sequence databases.
National Cancer Institute Thesaurus	| NCIT	| A vocabulary for clinical care, translational and basic research, and public information and administrative activities.
Ontology of Biomedical Investigations	| OBI	| OBI is an ontology of investigations, the protocols and instrumentation used, the material used, the data generated and the types of analysis performed on it.
Protein Ontology	| PRO	| PRO provides an ontological representation of protein-related entities by explicitly defining them and showing the relationships between them.
Uber Anatomy Ontology	| Uberon	| Uberon is an integrated cross-species anatomy ontology representing a variety of entities classified according to traditional anatomical criteria such as structure, function and developmental lineage. 
UniProt	| | The mission of UniProt is to provide the scientific community with a comprehensive, high-quality and freely accessible resource of protein sequence and functional information.
