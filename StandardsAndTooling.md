The CCDH aims to provide relevant standards and tooling for the CRDC community. Below are curated lists of relevant standards and tools for use in data harmonization, aggregation, modeling and other use cases. Please [contact us](centerforcancerdh@gmail.com) or join our [office hours](https://ccdhportaldev.pedscommons.org/support) for any questions related to ontologies, standards or tooling.

National Cancer Institute Thesaurus	| NCIT	| A vocabulary for clinical care, translational and basic research, and public information and administrative activities.
Ontology of Biomedical Investigations	| OBI	| OBI is an ontology of investigations, the protocols and instrumentation used, the material used, the data generated and the types of analysis performed on it.
Protein Ontology	| PRO	| PRO provides an ontological representation of protein-related entities by explicitly defining them and showing the relationships between them.
Uber Anatomy Ontology	| Uberon	| Uberon is an integrated cross-species anatomy ontology representing a variety of entities classified according to traditional anatomical criteria such as structure, function and developmental lineage. 
UniProt	| | The mission of UniProt is to provide the scientific community with a comprehensive, high-quality and freely accessible resource of protein sequence and functional information.
